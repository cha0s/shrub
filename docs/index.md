# Welcome!

Shrub is a full-stack JavaScript application framework. It is
organized into [packages](/) which implement
[hooks](hooks), as a means of communicating between each other and
influencing the way the entire application behaves.

The intention of Shrub is to allow you to build rich, powerful applications in
an elegant and structured way -- without needing to hack on or change Shrub's
core codebase. Everything you need should be doable by creating a new package.
If you find the opposite to be true, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/cha0s/shrub/issues)!

Tutorials in general are a bit lacking at the moment, this will be soon be
remedied!
